General Road Map:
1) Demo Project (done) 
 - See https://github.com/DanVioletSagmiller/UnitySOLID/tree/master/Trunk/Demo
 - Chain Reaction, is a game written without VS, without SOLID, without Unit Tests.
 - Chain Reacion Solid, the same game written in VS with SOLID, with Unit Tests.
 
2) Isolated Project
 - Isolated Project, so it can be added directly to extra projects.
 
3) Script Only version
 - A version the operates in Unity without being part of VS.  
 - would lose VS Unit Testing, but work as a Unity Asset.
 
4) Nuget Package
 - A nuget package for the isolated project, to be loaded on demand by other projects.
 
5) Nuget/Asset Manager
 - A system for automatically importing NUGET packages into Projects featuring certain Unity Assets, and adding assets when certain NUGET packages were found in the DLL.
