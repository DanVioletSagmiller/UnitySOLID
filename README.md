# UnitySOLID
SOLID for Unity.  Test Cases, Dependency Injection, etc.

This project focuses on adding SOLID to Unity, along with Unit Testing and Dependency Injection.  Basically most of the professional programming standards the business world is becomming acustomed to.

General Road Map:
1) Demo Project (done) 
 - See https://github.com/DanVioletSagmiller/UnitySOLID/tree/master/Trunk/Demo
 - Chain Reaction, is a game written without VS, without SOLID, without Unit Tests.
 - Chain Reacion Solid, the same game written in VS with SOLID, with Unit Tests.
 
2) Isolated Project
 - Isolated Project, so it can be added directly to extra projects.
 
3) Script Only version
 - A version the operates in Unity without being part of VS.  
 - would lose VS Unit Testing, but work as a Unity Asset.
 
4) Nuget Package
 - A nuget package for the isolated project, to be loaded on demand by other projects.
 
5) Nuget/Asset Manager
 - A system for automatically importing NUGET packages into Projects featuring certain Unity Assets, and adding assets when certain NUGET packages were found in the DLL.
 

First steps, orgainizing a forum, Wiki and a plan for community involvement.
